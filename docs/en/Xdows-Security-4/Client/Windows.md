## Developer Tools {#DevTools}

In normal mode, the client disables the context menu and does not allow shortcuts like `F12` or `Ctrl Shift J` to open the `Developer Tools`.

You can click the button next to the title bar icon (as shown below). After clicking, it may take a few seconds for the `Developer Tools` to open.
