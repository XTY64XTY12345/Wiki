## Kernel {#Kernel}

Both Xdows Security 3.0 and 4.0 build their UI based on web technologies, but their interaction with the UI differs.

 - Version 3.0 simply loads web pages in a browser, and the kernel captures JavaScript operations on the web pages to achieve its purpose. Besides WebUI, there are other components that cannot be customized.

 - Version 4.0 truly allows data exchange between the browser and the kernel. It only has WebUI, greatly enhancing customizability. Additionally, the UI has a certain degree of cross-platform compatibility.
